        <h5>What is this?</h5>
        <p>Getting Unstuck is a computer science curriculum for students in 4th, 5th, and 6th grade, using the Scratch programming environment. The curriculum aims to increase fluency with code through open-ended student-directed projects that are constrained in only one way: by using a particular Scratch block (or set of blocks).</p>

        <p>This curriculum supports students’ and teachers’ development of both conceptual fluency (that is, deepening understandings of key computer science concepts, like sequences, events, parallelism, and data) and creative fluency (that is, exploring the expansive possibilities of what can be made with code).</p>

        <p>Getting Unstuck is composed of 10 projects. Each project is organized around the creative computing design studio framework, which emphasizes learning through exploring, creating, sharing, and reflecting.</p>

        <p>We are sharing the curriculum under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.ast" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license</a>, which means that share and adapt the curriculum as long as you give appropriate credit and share adapted materials under the same license.</p> 

        <h5>Who is this for?</h5>
        <p>We designed this curriculum for teachers working with students in 4th, 5th, and/or 6th grade who have had some prior experience with Scratch, but the curriculum can be adapted for any grade level. This curriculum is designed for PK–12 teachers who are passionate or curious about supporting creative work with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> (a graphical programming language and online community being used by millions of young people around the world) in the classroom. Supporting students in pursuing creative work, with all of the twists and turns that can entail, can be tricky. As a teacher, in addition to having an adventurous spirit and genuine curiosity, it can help to have greater familiarity and fluency with Scratch. We chose the name Getting Unstuck to acknowledge the inherent challenges of creative work. As students pursue their creative dreams with code, there will likely be moments when they get stuck! We hope that the Getting Unstuck curriculum will support you and your students in navigating these moments and creating projects that are personally and socially meaningful.</p>

        <h2>What if I don’t know anything about Scratch?</h2>
        <p>No problem! We recommend starting with our <a href=”https://creativecomputing.gse.harvard.edu/creative-computing-curriculum.html” target=”_blank”>Creative Computing Curriculum</a> for introductory programming experiences with Scratch and/or participating in a <a href=”https://creativecomputing.gse.harvard.edu/scratch-educator-meetups.html” target=”_blank”>Scratch Educator Meetup</a>.

        <h5>Who are you?</h5>

        <p>We are Paulina Haduong (doctoral student), Dr. Karen Brennan (faculty member), and Mary Adelaide Williamson (project manager). We work, learn, and play at the <a href=”http://creativecomputing.gse.harvard.edu/” target=”_blank”>Creative Computing Lab</a> at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. We love designing learning experiences and helping people develop their creative computing confidence!</p>

        <p>The curriculum was made possible with the support of Creative Computing Lab current and former members Sara Smolevitz, Brian Yu, and Laura Peters, and we would also like to thank teachers who contributed to the design and testing of the curriculum: Kimberly Boyce-Quentin, Jennifer Ham, Susan Leifer, Bill Marsland, Mindy Pastuszak, Laurel Pollard, Aaron Reuland, and Bradley Quentin. The summer 2020 online professional learning experience was facilitated with Kimberly Boyce-Quentin, Bradley Quentin, and Susan Leifer, with additional contributions from Creative Computing Lab members Joshua Archibald, Amy Zhou, and Laura Peters. Special thanks to Priya Vetrimani, Associate Director of Infrastructure Technologies at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, for her abundantly generous support.</p>
