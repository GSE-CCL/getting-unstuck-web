            <p><strong>JULY 5-25, 2018</strong></p>
            <p><em>21 days. 21 Scratch projects. What will you make?</em></p>
    
            <p>Dear friends,</p>
            <p> Supporting creative work in the classroom can be challenging, and we want to help! We're excited to offer Getting Unstuck, a summer learning experience for teachers who want to learn more about supporting creative work with the Scratch programming language.</p>
    
            <p>Every day, you'll get an email with a small, creative programming challenge, designed to help you explore different computational concepts and debugging strategies in Scratch. You'll have access to a supportive <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TeachingwithScratch" target=”_blank”>online community</a> of teachers and facilitators. Whether you're brand new to Scratch or an experienced teacher, we'll be right beside you, making things and learning together.</p>
    
            <p>Yours in creative computing,
                <br/>Paulina and Karen</p>
