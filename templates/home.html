        <p><strong>JULY 6-17, 2020</strong></p>
        <p><em>10 days. 10 Scratch projects. What will you make?</em></p>

        <p>Dear friends,</p>
        <p>
            Supporting creative work in the classroom can be challenging, and we want to help!
            We&rsquo;re excited to offer Getting Unstuck, a summer learning experience for teachers
            who want to learn more about supporting creative work with the Scratch programming language.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every day, you&rsquo;ll get an email with a small, creative programming prompt,
            designed to help you explore different computational concepts and debugging strategies in Scratch.
            You&rsquo;ll have access to a supportive
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GettingUnstuckCommunity/" target=”_blank” class="text-black">online community</a>
            of teachers and facilitators. Whether you&rsquo;re brand new to Scratch or an experienced teacher,
            we&rsquo;ll be right beside you, making things and learning together.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-0">Yours in creative computing,</p>
        <p>Paulina and Karen</p>
