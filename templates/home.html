        <p><em>10 days. 10 Scratch projects. What will you make?</em></p>

        <p>Dear friends,</p>
        <p>
            Supporting creative work in the classroom can be challenging, and we want to help!
            We facilitated Getting Unstuck, a summer learning experience for teachers who wanted
            to learn more about supporting creative work with the Scratch programming language.
            Thank you for joining us!
        </p>
        <p>
            Every day, participants received an email with a small, creative programming prompt,
            designed to help participants explore different computational concepts and debugging
            strategies in Scratch. While the daily email experience is over, you can still view
            <a href="/prompts" class="text-white">the prompts</a> and access the
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GettingUnstuckCommunity" target="_blank" class="text-white">
                supportive online community
            </a>
            of teachers and facilitators. Whether you&rsquo;re brand new to Scratch or an experienced
            teacher, we hope you&rsquo;ll join us in getting unstuck!
        </p>
