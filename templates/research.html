<h5>Key Information</h5>

<p>The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether or not to be a part of this study. More detailed information is listed later on in this form.</p>

<p><strong>Why am I being invited to take part in a research study?</strong>
 <br>We invite you to take part in a research study because we are interested in understanding the impact of participation in the Getting Unstuck email course.</p>

<p><strong>What should I know about a research study?</strong>
 <ul>
   <li>+ Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
   <li>+ Your participation is completely voluntary.</li>
   <li>+ You can choose not to take part.</li>
   <li>+ You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
   <li>+ Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
   <li>+ You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.</li>
   <li>+ Your refusal to participate will not result in any consequences or any loss of benefits that you are otherwise entitled to receive.
 </ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Why is this research being done?</strong>
 <br>The purpose of the research is to learn more about how to design effective curricular materials to support teachers in learning and teaching debugging in the classroom. We hope to help educators like you by designing materials (like Scratch project challenges). </p>

<p><strong>How long will the research last and what will I need to do?</strong>
 <br>Getting Unstuck will run from July 6th to July 17th, 2020. We are interested in some information about who you are (through a quick 5-minute survey) at the beginning of the course, as well as information about your experience at the end of the course (through an optional 10-minute survey). At the end of the course, you will have the option to submit your studio of projects to be analyzed and to receive a certificate of completion.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</strong>
 <br>We don’t believe there are any risks from participating in this research.

<p><strong>Will being in this study help me in any way?</strong>
 <br>We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, possible benefits include more effective iterations of the Getting Unstuck email course, as well as better-designed curricular materials for you and other educators. We also hope that by practicing your Scratch skills daily, you build more of your own confidence.  </p>

<h5>Detailed Information</h5>
<p>The following is more detailed information about this study in addition to the information listed above.</p>

<p><strong>What is the purpose of this research?</strong>
<br>The purpose of this research is to learn more about how to design effective online materials to support teachers in learning and teaching debugging in Scratch, because supporting open-ended creative work in the classroom can be challenging when different students are getting stuck in a variety of ways. By participating in this study, we hope that your experiences can help shape the design of future resources. </p>

<p><strong>How long will I take part in this research?</strong>
<br>Getting Unstuck will run from July 6th to July 17th, 2020. We are interested in some information about who you are (through a quick 5-minute survey) at the beginning of the course, as well as information about your experience at the end of the course (through an optional 10-minute survey).
